## ShopeeAutobuyBot
Shopee Autobuy Bot is an automation program for Shopee (Malaysia) website. It uses [Selenium Framework](https://www.selenium.dev/) for the automation process.

This was a subscription based program and I decided to make this project open source. 

For now, to use this program will require user login. Mail me at sab@pxcore.net to 'register'.

I will update from time to time to get rid the program from login requirement so you can just use it straightway.

This program will be using external api as for the configuration and program updates.

Compiled program can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/pearlxcore/ShopeeAutobuyBot/releases).

**Use at your own risk.**
